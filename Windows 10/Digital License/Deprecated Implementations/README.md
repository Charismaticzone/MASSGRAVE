# Deprecated Implementations
## Information
The HWIDWizard code is poorly formatted due to being simply ripped out of the executable; The executable itself will not be distributed as a release.
gatherosstate will not be distributed with the implementation and must be acquired separately if needed.

The original executable was made by using an AHK to EXE converter.
