# Work In Progress
# The MASSGRAVE Project
**MASSGRAVE** is short for MASSGRAVE Antiexploitation Solutions for Stopping the
Growth of Ruinous Activation Via Exploitation.

It is a reverse engineering effort researching the Microsoft Windows activation services in hopes of finding exploits for documentation, further research and development of software auditing solutions.

Important parts of the project will include:
 * Detailed documentation
 * Visualizations and flowcharts for aforementioned documentation
 * Example exploitation tools
 * (If Applicable) Ideas for software aimed at detection and prevention of exploitation

# The Purpose of This Project
The focus of this project is the documentation of Microsoft Windows' activation process exploits (activators etc.) and, in the future, development of a software auditing solution capable of illegal activation detection.

This documentation along with working examples serves both educational purposes and enables the development of exploitation prevention software with the focus on detection, prevention and (if possible) removal of said exploits.

This project is motivated by the unwillingness of (at least some) network/domain administrators to be held responsible for illegal software being smuggled into otherwise clean environments. Hopefully the final product will be a complete repository of documentation for various activation methods along with complete solutions for detecting and getting rid of them from both local environments and networks.

# Roadmap
Gradually, we'd like to include information on activation methods for earlier versions of Windows and more universal approaches, such as fake Online/Offline KMS servers.

Right now, the repository is very small and doesn't contain much information. As of now the focus is very thoroughly documenting KMS38 and Digital License activation methods. A lot of work is yet to be done, such as providing proper sources, preparing diagrams and writing examples.
